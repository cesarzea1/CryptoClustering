Data analytics bootcamp Module 19 Challenge

The requested file 'Crypto_Clustering' and analysis are saved in the repository.

The answers to the proposed questions:
- Question: What is the best value for k?
    Answer: 4 as it shows a bend in the elbow curve with the lowest inertia.
- What is the total explained variance of the three principal components (PCA)?
    Answer: Explained Variance per Principal Component: [0.3719856  0.34700813 0.17603793]
    the total explained variance is 0.89503166, or 89.5%
- What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
    Answer: Based on the elbow curve, the best K value is also 4, as it show a proper bend at the lowest inertia.
- Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
    Answer: No. Both methods show a similar result.
- After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
    Answer: the Elbow curves show a similar trend and point to the same optimal K point (4). The clusters graphics show a relative more clarity for the one using the PCA solution. The PCA plot clusters allow for a clearer definition of the groups with the advantage of using less dimensions.
